## Contract Template Overview

The Founding Contributor Engagement Agreement is built on two core principles:

### 1. Protections
- **IP Ownership**: Clear definition of company vs. personal intellectual property
- **Mutual Commitment**: Quarterly performance reviews and accountability
- **Non-Solicitation**: 12-month restrictions on poaching employees/customers
- **Code Reuse**: 12-month restrictions on competitive use of company code

### 2. Compensations
- **Accelerating Equity Vesting**: Logarithmic schedule rewarding long-term commitment
- **Deferred Wages**: Pro-rata payment system when company becomes profitable
- **6-Month Cliff**: No equity vests before completing 180 days of work
- **Transparent Tracking**: Shared digital time logs with dispute resolution

## Key Formulas

### Vesting Calculation
```
Vested Equity = Total Equity Ã— ((Days Worked - Cliff Days) / (Total Vesting Days - Cliff Days))Â²
```

### Deferred Wage Distribution
```
Distribution Percentage = Available Profit / Total Accrued Wages
Individual Payment = Individual Accrued Wages Ã— Distribution Percentage
```

## Usage Examples

### For Founders
1. Use the **Vesting Calculator** to determine appropriate equity grants
2. Set up **Deferred Compensation** terms for fair wage accrual
3. Review **Contract Details** to understand all protections and terms

### For Contributors
