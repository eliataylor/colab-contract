## Contract Template Overview

The Founding Contributor Engagement Agreement is built on two core principles:

### 1. Protections

- **Code Reuse**: 12-month restrictions on competitive use of company code

### 2. Compensations
- **Accelerating Equity Vesting**: Logarithmic schedule rewarding long-term commitment
- **Deferred Wages**: Pro-rata payment system when company becomes profitable
- **6-Month Cliff**: No equity vests before completing 180 days of work
- **Transparent Tracking**: Shared digital time logs with dispute resolution
